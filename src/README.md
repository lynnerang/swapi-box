# Swapi Box App

This project is a Turing front-end evelopment project focused on working with React and Enzyme/Jest.

This is an app for people who would like to browse through Star Wars data and keep track of their favorite people/planets/vehicles.  It pulls certain details for each category of data from the Swapi API.
